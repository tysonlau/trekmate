# Trekmate

### Target Audience:
TrekMate is intended for hikers of all ages and/or people who like going outside with close ones.

### Abstract:
TrekMate is an online web application that allows users to view information on hiking trails, find new trails to explore, and log the trails they have conquered– all while being able to connect with friends and loved ones. By signing up / logging in, users can have access to features like a log system that allows users to track the hikes they accomplished (which is viewable on their profile), as well as a search system that allows users to find hikes based on location, difficulty, and rating. Most importantly, however, TrekMate implements a system that allows the user to set up or join private or public hike meetups. This makes TrekMate a universal tool for all hikers, both new and experienced, to interact and track their adventures.

### Overview of Current Systems:
Many hiking apps provide a variety of features. Most of them overlap with what they do, such as detailed descriptions of what the trails look like, wildlife surrounding the area, and difficulty of hikes among many of the other features. Some of them also require the usage of GPS to help users track where they are. For a price, benefits can be gained, like the ability to be used offline as well. 

### How We Plan to Improve This:
What we noticed is that most apps lack an emphasis on the social aspects. Users can’t conveniently connect with their friends, and people often enjoy going on hikes with their close ones– yet no app has implemented this. Our web application provides various features on top of this. We want to highlight the hiking scene with those inclined to go with their friends. TrekMate adds a variety of features to improve quality of life; being able to add your friends to see what they’re up to, allowing users to log their recent hikes as a public post, create group hiking events with notifications, and environmental warnings (i.e. sightings of bears, extremely busy, weather). Additionally, TrekMate will allow you to keep track of all the hikes you’ve been on, and the future ones you’re planning with your close ones. To achieve our goals with TrekMate, the APIs involved will be the Google Maps API, the Google Calendar API, and the Weather API. Overall, TrekMate offers all the necessary information one needs for hikes, while also being able to collaborate with others.
